# 1. Guess The Number Game:
# -we will generate a random number with the help of randint() function from 1 to 100 and ask the user to guess it.
# -After every guess, the user will be told if the number is above or below the randomly generated number.
# -The user will win if they guess the number maximum five attempts.
# -Ask the user to stop or continue playing again.
